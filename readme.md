#### Unmet Objectives

- Required content was in place by the Friday deadline.
- Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦"
- The project repo contains a README that includes: author name, project name, description, setup instructions, link to GitHub Pages, and copyright info.

#### Instructor Notes

Hey Tyler! It looks like you were generally able to meet the objectives here, but you haven't completed everything that's needed to get this passing. Here's what you still need in order to meet all the objectives:

1. You need to put in another three hours of work or more on this project. Your commits on Friday start at 10:00 and end at 3:40 which shakes out to a little under five hours of work. That should break out to about six more commits if you commit every half hour.

2. You need to flesh out your readme. It doesn't meet the requirements outlined in the prompt. Reread the prompt and check out the lesson on readmes in week one, then go back and add a readme that checks all the boxes. Don't forget to link your gh-pages url in there!

Once you've addressed the two points above, this should pass! Please resubmit no later than Monday at 8:00 AM.

Nice work! Josh
